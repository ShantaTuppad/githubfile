The heart of the village was the large banyan tree in the central square. Under its vast canopy, villagers would gather for meetings, celebrations, and festivals. It was here that the villageâ€™s most cherished event, the Mango Festival, took place. During this festival, the village transformed into a lively carnival with music, dance, and an array of mango dishes. Everyone from the youngest child to the oldest elder participated, celebrating their bountiful harvest and the joy of being part of such a vibrant community.

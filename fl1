Once upon a time, in a serene village nestled between lush green hills and a sparkling river, there lived a tight-knit community of villagers. This village, called Aamrapali, was known for its fragrant mango orchards that stretched as far as the eye could see. The villagers took great pride in their orchards, which provided not only sustenance but also a means of livelihood.
